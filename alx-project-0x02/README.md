This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn-pages-router) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Project Description
This project is a comprehensive introduction to setting up and working with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. It guides you through creating a modern web application with reusable components, routing, API integration, and proper project structure. The project covers fundamental concepts from initial setup to building interactive components and fetching data from external APIs.

Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you will:

Understand how to scaffold a Next.js application with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
Learn to implement basic routing in Next.js using the Pages Router
Create reusable components with TypeScript interfaces
Implement interactive UI elements like modals and buttons
Fetch and display data from external APIs
Structure a Next.js project following best practices
Work with component props and state management
Build responsive layouts with navigation
Requirements
Node.js (v16 or later)
npm or yarn package manager
Basic knowledge of React and TypeScript
Familiarity with HTML/CSS
Git and GitHub account
Code editor (VS Code recommended)
Best Practices
Project Structure:

Organize components by domain (layout, common, etc.)
Keep interfaces in a dedicated folder
Separate pages according to routes
Component Design:

Create reusable, modular components
Use TypeScript interfaces for props
Follow single responsibility principle
Code Quality:

Use ESLint for linting
Maintain consistent code style
Add meaningful comments where necessary
Performance:

Optimize API calls
Implement lazy loading where appropriate
Use Tailwind CSS for efficient styling
Documentation:

Maintain a clear README
Document component props and usage
Keep commit messages descriptive

Implementation Guide
Start by setting up the Next.js project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
Implement basic routing with the Pages Router
Build reusable components one by one, starting with simple ones (Card, Button)
Progress to more complex components (Modal, PostCard, UserCard)
Implement the Header component for navigation
Fetch and display data from JSONPlaceholder API
Test each component and page as you build them
Expected Outcomes
A fully functional Next.js application
Reusable components that follow TypeScript best practices
Proper routing between different pages
API integration to fetch and display data
Responsive design using Tailwind CSS
Clean, well-organized codebase
